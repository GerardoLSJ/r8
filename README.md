# r8
Frontend part of the main project https://github.com/sebassilva/r8.me

##Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/GerardoLSJ/r8.git

cd r8

npm install
```
then:

```
live-server
```

if you don't have installed ´live-server´ just add it with npm:

```
sudo npm install live-server -g
```

the sudo is requiered because is a global installation (-g), alternatively you can serve the "index.html" with any other server for example: 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 
```

but I haven't tried it
